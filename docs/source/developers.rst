Developing on Livepeer
===================

Livepeer is an open development platform. Some of the things that can be built on top of, or within Livepeer include:

* Live video featuers within an app or DApp
* Infrastructure tools and services for existing broadcasters or live streamers
* Tools for the Livepeer ecosystem, including the Livepeer SDK_, Livepeer `core protocol`_ and clients_ themselves

Contributing to Livepeer
--------------------------

For developers who are looking for interesting to problems to work on related to decentralized tech, blockchain, cryptocurrency, video engineering, and peer-to-peer networking, Livepeer may provide some interesting challenges. The three technical areas that Livepeer focuses on today are:

* Protocol implementation (Smart Contract)
* Livepeer Node (Distributed Systems / Networking)
* Livepeer Media Server (Video Engineering)
  
For the protocol , you can follow the `protocol repo`_. It requires some background in `Solidity`_ and the `Livepeer Whitepaper`_.

For the livepeer node, check out the `go-livepeer repo`_ and `go-livepeer-basicnet repo`_. It requires some understanding of Golang, `libp2p`_, and `Geth`_. Setting up a development enviroment can be done by following `thoses instructions`_.

For the livepeer media server implementation, take a look at the `LPMS repo`_. It requires some video engineering knowledge. The `demuxed conf videos`_ and the `Apple Live streaming doc`_ are good resources to start learning.

If you're interested in the any of the above challenges, or are building video features into an application, jump into our `development chat room on Discord`_ and join the conversation.
