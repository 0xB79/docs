<ParamField path="Asset">
An Asset is representing a video object that can be identified, stored and processed within Livepeer. Livepeer is responsible for the life cycle management (i.e. CRUD) of an Asset. An Asset has a unique Asset ID and a well-defined metadata describing its characteristics (see the screenshot). An asset is created only when a video is uploaded to Livepeer successfully through its API, or when a recording is converted to an Asset.

An Asset can only be deleted using Livepeer API or in Studio. When an Asset is created successfully, `asset.created` webhook event is fired to allow customized processing logic triggered, while `asset.failed` fired otherwise. Viewer Engagement Metrics [REF]provide more comprehensive of viewer behavior using Livepeer Engagement API.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Stream">
A Stream is representing a Live Stream Object that can be identified, recorded, and processed within Livepeer. Stream is a video feed being broadcasted in real-time. Livepeer is responsible for the life cycle management (CRUD) of a Stream. A Stream is uniquely identified by the Stream ID, and associated with a defined metadata describing its characteristics (see the screenshot). A Stream is created when create stream API (`POST /stream`)  is executed successfully. Once a Stream is created, there are set of webhook events to notify its state transitions, including `stream.started`, `stream.idle`.

If Recording [a ref to Recording Concept] is enabled, there is a set of webhook events to notify recording’s state transitions including: `recording.ready`, `recording.started`, `recording.waiting`. The recording can be stored as an Asset[Ref to Asset]. A Stream can also be directed to multiple stream targets, such as youbube, twitter, using MultiStream[REF]. Using Livepeer Player[REF], a stream can be easily viewed by passing Playback ID, while using 3rd party player, a full playback url is required.

RTMP is the ingest protocol for streaming, while WebRTC by default is playback protocol and HLS as fall back, when Livepeer Player is used. WebRTC will ensure a low latency playback around 2-5s on transcoded renditions, and sub-s on source.

While a Stream is delivered, Stream Health [REF] is an object provides a set of metrics about its monitoring state. Further more, Viewer Engagement Metrics [REF]provide more comprehensive of viewer behavior using Livepeer Engagement API.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Room">
A "Room" is a fundamental conceptual unit within the Livepeer, representing a virtual space or container for hosting real-time interactive sessions in a participant stream. This construct facilitates synchronized communication and collaboration, making it a cornerstone for various real-time experiences.

In a Room, participants have the ability to engage in dynamic interactions and exchange audio, video, and other data streams. The Room acts as a environment where participants can connect and communicate with each other in a seamless and coordinated manner. When a Room is created, it establishes a shared session that enables individuals to join, share content, and interact with one another in a multi-participant context.

The creation of a Room can be initiated using Livepeer’s Room API[REF] and automatically triggered when the first participant enters. As participants join and leave the Room, updates about changes to other participants and their activities are communicated to ensure a synchronized state. For instance, modifications to participant tracks, such as additions, removals, or changes in state (like muting), are broadcast to all other participants within the same Room.

To initiate multi-participant live streams, the Room API can be used to generate a unique room identifier. This identifier allows participants to easily join the designated Room and become part of the dynamic real-time interaction facilitated within that digital environment.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Access control">
  Gated Playback is a webhook based framework for applications to customize
  their authorized video/stream playback control. Whenever a stream playback
  request is initiated, Livepeer initiated a `playback.accessControl` webhook
  event, as a result, applications can register a webhook handler to respond to
  this event by checking the Access Control Conditions. If it is authorized,
  Livepeer will enable “playback”, otherwise rejected. Using this framework, a
  blockchain agonistic Token Gating feature can be easily implemented. Rich ACC
  providers, such as lit has been integrated.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Livepeer Webhook Event">

A webhook trigger event refers to a specific occurrence or action in Livepeer that prompts the webhook to send data to another system. Once this pre-determined event takes place, the webhook activates, "pushing" relevant information or notifications to a designated endpoint.

> Livepeer Webhook Event, is a collection of webhook events fired when a state is satisfied. [Here](https://docs.livepeer.org/guides/developing/listen-for-webhooks#types-of-events) is the detailed definition of each event.

### Types of Events

</ParamField>

<ParamField  path="Player">
Livepeer Player is a drop-in component that you can put in your web or native mobile application (supporting reactive native) to play Livepeer Assets [REF]. 
Livepeer Player supports:
- on-demand assets
- live streams
- low-latency live streams

Livepeer Player can be used as either a web component `<Player />` from livepeer.js.

Livepeer Player is fully-featured video player for content hosted by Livepeer. Livepeer Player is fully integrated with Livepeer Engagement Metrics Data without any extra configuration. Livepeer Player provides a responsive UI based on video player dimensions and stream type, automatic thumbnail previews and poster images, and modern video player capabilities (fullscreen, picture-in-picture, Chromecast, Airplay).

</ParamField>

<ParamField  path="Multistream">
A multistream is an advanced capability within the Livepeer that facilitates the simultaneous broadcast of a source stream, along with its transcoded renditions, to various RTMP(s) destinations like Twitch, Facebook Live, and YouTube Live. This feature ensures that users can maximize their audience reach across multiple platforms with a single streaming session.

In setting up multistreaming, users have the option to either utilize the Studio[REF] or directly interface with the Livepeer REST API[REF] or the Livepeer SDK[REF]. All options offer comprehensive management tools to configure, modify, or delete specific Multistream Targets linked with individual streams. It's important to note that configurations are stream-specific; hence, they don't automatically transfer when generating new streams. The essential parameters for setting up a target include naming the target, adding the mandatory Ingest URL, and, if relevant, adding a stream key, provided by Livepeer. Users can also specify which rendition profile they intend to dispatch to the target.

After creating a Multistream Target, there's flexibility in toggling its activation status. Both the dashboard and API provide options for editing or deleting these targets. However, to initiate multistreaming, merely establishing a Multistream Target object isn't sufficient. This target needs to be referenced within the Stream object it's associated with.

For performance monitoring and understanding stream health, Studio offers real-time indicators through its dashboard and API, showing whether a Multistream Target is currently active or offline. Such status updates might experience slight delays before the stream's live status gets mirrored on the destination platform. Via the dashboard's "Health" tab, users can obtain a detailed view of the ingest rate for the active source stream.

Additionally, Livepeer have three webhooks to monitor Multistream Targets:

1. `multistream.connected`: Indicates a successful connection to the Multistream Target and confirms the stream's live status on the corresponding service.
2. `multistream.error`: Flags issues during the connection process, suggesting potential configuration errors or problems with the destination platform.
3. `multistream.disconnected`: Notifies users when a stream concludes and multistreaming to a particular target has also ended.

</ParamField>

<ParamField  path="Encrypted Asset">
An Encrypted Asset refers to a video object within the Livepeer that has undergone cryptographic encryption for security purposes, ensuring its contents remain confidential and are only accessible to authorized users. The encryption process utilizes a 256-bit[REF] key generated using the 'AES-CBC' algorithm[REF]. This key encrypts the video file, and then this encryption key itself is encrypted using the Livepeer Public Key, a form of asymmetric encryption. This double layer of encryption ensures that the video content remains secure during its life cycle in Livepeer.

To create an Encrypted Asset, one must first generate an encryption key, use it to encrypt their video content, retrieve the Livepeer Public Key, and then encrypt the original encryption key. The encrypted video file, alongside its encrypted encryption key, is then uploaded to Livepeer. Livepeer only supports video content encrypted using the `SubtleCrypto.encrypt` method with the AES-CBC algorithm, compatible with other web3 protocols like Lit [REF].

When an Encrypted Asset is uploaded to Livepeer, a playback URL is generated. Access to this URL and the contents of the Encrypted Asset can be controlled through playback policies [REF to access control concept], ensuring content security and selective accessibility.

To decrypt and view the asset, the correct decryption key, which has been encrypted using Livepeer's Public Key, is required. Thus, even if one has the playbackId or playbackUrl, without the appropriate decryption capabilities, the Encrypted Asset remains secure and unviewable.

</ParamField>

<ParamField  path="Stream Health">

Stream Health is a multi-faceted indicator representing the operational and performance status of a video stream within Livepeer.

1. Global Health Status: This is a holistic status of the stream. It can be one of the following:
   - Healthy: All health checks are in a good state.
   - Unhealthy: One or more health checks indicate a problem.
   - Idle: The stream is not currently active.
2. Health Checks: These are specific metrics that contribute to the global health status of the stream. They include:
   - Transcoding: Shows if video transcoding is successful and multiple stream profiles are available for playback. An unhealthy status implies only the original video is available.
   - Real-time: Indicates if the stream is transcoded faster than in real-time, meaning the latency of the transcoded video is less than the duration of the original video.
   - Multistreaming: Reflects the connection status of all configured Multistream Targets. It can show the following states:
     - Idle: Stream and multistreaming aren't active.
     - Pending: The system is trying to connect to the Multistream Target.
     - Online: Successful connection to the Multistream Target.
     - Offline: There was an error connecting to the Multistream Target.
3. Logs: Provide alerts and error messages related to the streaming process. This includes notifications such as when the stream starts/stops or if there are any fatal errors during the transcoding process.
4. Session Ingest Rate: This is a measure of the bitrate of the video being received by the Livepeer servers. It's updated every 10 seconds. A high, stable bitrate indicates good stream quality and a reliable internet connection, while a fluctuating or low bitrate might point to potential issues with the encoder or the streamer's internet connection.
5. Monitoring Tools: Stream Health can be monitored in two primary ways:
   - Studio: Offers a visual representation with health indicators for an active stream, including a chart showing the ingest rate.
   - REST API & SDK: Allows for querying the health information of a stream, including detailed metrics and events sent by the Livepeer video-processing services.
6. Health Metrics (from API): When using the API, you can retrieve detailed metrics about the stream's health. This includes:
   - Conditions: These represent specific states of stream health, such as whether the stream is active, if it's transcoding in real-time, and if there are no errors during transcoding. Each condition provides a status, frequency, and timestamps for when the condition was last checked and when it last changed.
   - Metrics: Experimental at the time of the document, they provide specific measurements related to stream health.

By monitoring and analyzing these various facets, users can ensure the optimum performance and reliability of their streams on the Livepeer.

</ParamField>

<ParamField  path="Orchestrator">

An Orchestrator in Livepeer network is an entity or node that facilitates the video processing tasks such as transcoding. Orchestrators provide their computational resources, which can include CPU, GPU, and bandwidth, to assist broadcasters and developers in transcoding/delivering videos. By running specific software, like the `go-livepeer` client [REF], individuals can join the Livepeer network as Orchestrators.

In essence, Orchestrators play a pivotal role in transcoding and distributing video streams on the Livepeer network. They advertise the price they would charge for their video processing services, and when a job is directed their way, it is routed to their computational resources for execution. Importantly, Orchestrators can leverage different parts of their GPUs to handle video encoding tasks without significantly interrupting other tasks, like cryptocurrency mining. This setup allows for optimal utilization of the Orchestrator's resources.

Moreover, Orchestrators earn fees for their service. These fees can be in the form of cryptocurrencies such as ETH or stablecoins pegged to traditional currencies, like DAI. To become an active Orchestrator and be eligible for these rewards, they need to stake a certain amount of LPT tokens. The active set of Orchestrators comprises the top 100 Orchestrators with the highest stake on the network. Activation, management of rates, and other settings can be done through tools like `livepeer_cli`.

For ease of operation and to ensure they are accessible for jobs, Orchestrators are required to set up specific parameters and ensure they have the necessary prerequisites, including proper networking configurations, accessibility to Arbitrum nodes, sufficient bandwidth, and more. They can also manage their ETH accounts for transactions and rewards either manually or let the Livepeer system handle it automatically.

In summary, Orchestrators are essential components of the Livepeer ecosystem, offering their computational resources for video processing while earning rewards for their contributions.

</ParamField>

<ParamField  path="Delegators">
Delegators are a crucial group within the Livepeer protocol, playing a vital but passive role in the system's operations and security. They are individuals or entities who hold Livepeer tokens and, rather than actively processing or broadcasting video content themselves, opt to back and support other active participants - Orchestrators. By "staking" their tokens, which can be equated to placing a deposit, Delegators essentially lock up their tokens for a designated period, signaling their trust and support for chosen Orchestrators [REF].

The act of staking helps in multiple ways. Firstly, it reinforces the network's overall security by ensuring participants have a vested interest in the system's proper functioning. The locked tokens can serve as a form of collateral, ensuring the system remains resistant to malicious intentions or attacks.

Apart from security, staking also empowers Delegators with the right to have a say in the network's governance. They can weigh in on protocol proposals, thus making collaborative decisions on the network's future direction. Additionally, the amount of staked and delegated token determines how tasks or jobs are distributed within the network, thereby acting as a mechanism for work coordination.

Delegators can get Livepeer tokens (LPT) [REF], which are ERC-20 compliant, through various channels, including trading platforms like Uniswap [REF]. The distribution of these tokens was initially executed via a 'Merkle Mine' technique during the network's inception phase. The token's value is subject to inflation based on an algorithmic issuance model over time.

For those interested in exploring or managing their staking activities, the Livepeer Explorer [REF] offers a comprehensive interface, ensuring transparency and ease of operations in the staking process.

</ParamField>

<ParamField  path="Livepeer Network">
The Livepeer Network is an Ethereum-based decentralized infrastructure designed to revolutionize video processing and distribution by providing a secure, cost-effective, and efficient solution for content creators and developers. At its core, the Livepeer Network operates as a platform that connects two key types of participants: orchestrators[REF] and delegators [REF].

The network's native asset, the Livepeer Token (LPT), serves as a coordination and incentive mechanism within the Livepeer Network. LPT is used to facilitate the distribution of video processing tasks among orchestrators and to incentivize their active participation. Orchestrators are allocated tasks based on the amount of LPT they have staked, their geographical location, and their reliability. The more LPT staked, the more tasks are allocated, leading to higher rewards.

[IMAGE HERE]

The Livepeer Network operates on a round-based model, with each round typically lasting about 24 hours. New LPT tokens are minted at the end of each round and distributed to both delegators and orchestrators based on their stakes. This issuance mechanism ensures that participants who contribute actively to the network receive a proportionate share of the rewards, while those who are less active receive fewer rewards.

Overall, the Livepeer Network addresses the challenges of traditional centralized video processing methods by creating a decentralized ecosystem that leverages distributed processing power, incentivized participation, and a transparent rewards distribution system. This network empowers content creators, developers, and users by offering a more efficient and democratized approach to video transcoding and distribution.

</ParamField>

<ParamField  path="Studio">

Studio is an all-in one dashboard and toolkit offered by Livepeer, designed for developer in creating, broadcasting, and sharing video content on the decentralized web through the Livepeer Protocol.

It adheres to standard HTTP response codes, authentication methods, and HTTP verbs for consistent and efficient communication.

Authentication within the Studio API is achieved using API keys, specifically utilizing Bearer Authentication. API keys play a crucial role in verifying and authorizing requests made to the API. These keys are managed through Livepeer Studio and must be included in the header of API requests, prefixed by the term 'Bearer'.

```
Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

</ParamField>

<ParamField  path="In-browser Broadcast">

An in-browser broadcast refers to the process of transmitting live video content directly from a user's web browser to online audiences in real-time, facilitated by Livepeer's low latency WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology. This method eliminates the need for specialized broadcasting equipment or external software such as OBS, allowing content creators to engage with their viewers effortlessly.

Process Overview:

- Configuration and Initialization:
  - A Livepeer client is established within the web application using the `livepeer.js` library, creating a connection to Livepeer's infrastructure.
  - A live stream object, known as a "Stream,"[REF] is created through Livepeer's API, setting the foundation for the live video feed.
- Broadcast Initiation:
  - The broadcasting interface is seamlessly integrated into the web application using the `Broadcast` component provided by the `livepeer.js` library.
  - The component is configured with the appropriate stream key, and custom styling options are applied to ensure a consistent user experience.
- WebRTC Broadcasting:
  - The user's webcam and microphone capture live video and audio content directly from the browser.
  - WebRTC technology is employed to transmit this media content to Livepeer's infrastructure in real-time.
- Stream Presentation:
  - The live video content is made accessible to viewers through an embedded iframe or player on the web page.
  - The iframe references a specific URL associated with the stream key, allowing viewers to watch the broadcast.
- STUN/TURN Server Utilization:
  - STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers are utilized to enhance network connectivity, ensuring minimal disruptions due to firewalls or network challenges.

In-browser broadcasting through Livepeer's WebRTC technology empowers content creators to effortlessly share live video content with their audiences, fostering real-time engagement and interaction directly from the web browser.

</ParamField>

<ParamField  path="Multi-participant Live Stream">

A Multi-Participant Live Stream is a dynamic and collaborative broadcasting format. It enables real-time interactions between multiple participants, allowing them to engage in virtual gatherings, meetings, conferences, or similar events. This type of live stream involves the simultaneous participation of several individuals, each contributing their video and audio feeds to create a comprehensive and engaging multimedia experience for viewers.

A multi-participant live stream can be created using the `Room` API , which generates a unique room ID. Participants are added to the virtual room using the `participant` API call. Each participant is identified by a human-readable display name, and they contribute their video and audio streams to the live stream.

It's important to note that Livepeer's underlying technology leverages LiveKit, an open-source project based on WebRTC. This technology ensures scalability and reliability for managing multi-user interactions and streaming capabilities, resulting in a seamless and interactive Multi-Participant Live Stream experience.

Developers can utilize custom front-end interfaces built using Livepeer and Livekit client SDKs. This approach involves passing the authentication token received from the API response to access the virtual room and participate in the live stream.

</ParamField>

<ParamField  path="Video On-Demand">
Video on Demand (VoD) refers to a content delivery model that allows users to access and watch video content at their convenience. In the context of the Livepeer, Video on Demand refers to the capability to upload, store, and view video assets. VoD provides users with the flexibility to select and play videos as desired, unlike traditional broadcast or scheduled streaming where content is delivered in real-time.

Key Aspects of Video on Demand on the Livepeer:

- Asset Creation and Uploading: VoD allows users to create and upload video assets to the Livepeer. These assets can include prerecorded videos, movies, tutorials, or any other type of video content.
- Asset Management: Once uploaded, video assets are managed within the Livepeer ecosystem. Each asset is associated with unique metadata, such as its name, description, and characteristics. These metadata attributes facilitate organization and searchability of the content.
- Asset Processing: After uploading, video assets undergo processing to make them available for playback. This processing can involve various steps, including transcoding the video into different formats and qualities to accommodate different devices and network conditions.
- Playback: Once processed, users can initiate playback of their video assets. The Video on Demand model allows viewers to start, pause, resume, and rewind videos at their convenience.
- Asynchronous Viewing: Unlike live streaming, where content is streamed in real-time, VoD enables asynchronous viewing. Users can access the content whenever they want, eliminating the need to follow a fixed schedule.
- Player Integration: Livepeer provides player integration features that allow users to embed and display the video player within their applications or websites. This player facilitates seamless playback and user interaction.
- Storage Options: Video assets can be stored using different storage options, such as IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or Arweave. Storing assets on decentralized platforms like IPFS ensures durability, availability, and decentralized access to the content.

Livestream refers to the real-time broadcasting of audio and visual content over the internet, allowing viewers to watch events, presentations, or other activities as they happen. In the context of the Livepeer platform, a live stream involves creating, broadcasting, and watching live video content in a seamless manner.

Key Aspects of livestream on the Livepeer

- Stream Creation: Live streaming begins with the creation of a stream. This involves defining a stream name and, optionally, configuring transcoding profiles that determine the quality and formats in which the live stream will be available.
- Stream Start: Once the stream is created, the broadcasting process begins. Users can start the livestream using a unique stream key associated with the stream with OBS or in-browser broadcast offered Livepeer. The stream key ensures that only authorized users can contribute content to the stream.
- Playback Policy: Streams can have different playback policies. By default, streams are set to public, allowing anyone with the `playbackId` to view the content. Other policies, such as JWT-based authentication, can be implemented for secure access.
- Stream Management: Livepeer offers capabilities to manage live streams, including starting, pausing, resuming, and stopping streams. These features provide flexibility and control to content creators during live events.
- Playback Accessibility: Once the live stream is ended, the content can be made available for on-demand playback (if recording is enabled), allowing viewers who missed the live event to watch it at a later time.
- Metrics and Analytics: Livepeer provide real-time analytics about viewer count, engagement, and other relevant metrics, helping content creators and developers assess the success and impact of their live streams.
