## Asset

An asset or VOD is a stored video unit, complete with its related details like title and transcoded versions. It's the video content that users can request and watch anytime they want. Any changes made to these videos are quickly updated in the system, and you can manage or stream them using our API. Simply put, think of it as a video file that's ready to play whenever a user asks for it.

## Stream

A stream refers to a video feed being broadcast in real-time. Unlike an "Asset" which is pre-recorded content, a stream captures and delivers video as it's happening. Users can tune in to watch these live broadcasts as they occur. It's like watching a live event on TV, but through Livepeer. If you want to share content with viewers as it unfolds, this is the way to go.

## Room

A room signifies a virtual space where multiple participants can join and interact in real-time. Think of it as a digital meeting spot. Inside a Room, participants can share video, audio, or other data streams with each other. It's central for collaborative activities, live discussions, or any situation where multi-way communication is essential. When you create a Room, you're setting up a shared session where people can connect and engage together.

## Participant

A participant refers to any individual who joins a Room. They represent active users in a multi-participant session and can share or receive video, audio, or other data streams. Every participant has a unique identifier, making it easy to manage and differentiate them. Simply put, if a Room is like a digital meeting space, Participants are the attendees engaging within that space.

## Access control

In Livepeer, access control denotes the measures and protocols in place to manage who can enter or interact within a specific asset or stream. It ensures that only authorized participants can join sessions or access specific resources. This can be managed through password protection, token verification, or other authentication methods. Essentially, access control acts as a security gatekeeper, determining who gets in and who stays out, safeguarding privacy and content integrity.

## Usage

Usage in the context of VOD and Stream refers to the cumulative resources and services utilized when content is processed, stored, and delivered. For VOD, this can encompass the duration a video is stored, the amount of time it's viewed, and the resources used to transcode it for optimal viewing. For streaming, usage can relate to the length of live broadcasts, the bandwidth consumed during these streams, and the number of viewers accessing the stream in real-time.

## Webhook

A "webhook" is a method for one system (Livepeer) to provide real-time information to another system (your app) as soon as an event occurs. Instead of a system continuously checking or polling another system for updates, the platform will simply send (or "push") data immediately after a specific event happens such as when an asset is ready to play. Webhooks are commonly used in applications to integrate different systems and services, ensuring they can react promptly to new events or changes.

## Webhook Trigger Event

A webhook trigger event refers to a specific occurrence or action in Livepeer that prompts the webhook to send data to another system. Once this pre-determined event takes place, the webhook activates, "pushing" relevant information or notifications to a designated endpoint.

## Recording

Recording refers to the process of capturing and saving a video stream for later playback. While the content is being broadcasted in real-time, Livepeer simultaneously stores a copy of that content. This allows users to access, review, or share the broadcast even after the live event has concluded. Recording streams is particularly useful for creating archives, ensuring content longevity, or allowing viewers who missed the live broadcast to watch it at their convenience

## Player

The Player is a component designed for easily play video content. Tailored to work with a Livepeer provider, the Player intuitively manages various source formats, including WebRTC, MP4, and HLS. Its integration ensures swift and smooth playback, minimizing delays regardless of network conditions. Simply put, it's your go-to tool for consistent and efficient media playback.

## HLS

HLS, or HTTP Live Streaming, is a streaming protocol developed by Apple. It's designed to deliver audio and video content over the internet, ensuring optimal playback regardless of network conditions. HLS works by breaking down the content into a series of small segments, typically of a few seconds each, and delivering them via HTTP.

## WebRTC

WebRTC Video Playback refers to the ability to receive and display video content in real-time using the WebRTC protocol. Unlike traditional video streaming methods that involve buffering and rely on specific server infrastructures, WebRTC video playback facilitates immediate, peer-to-peer streaming. This results in minimal latency.

## API Key

An API-Key is a code passed along with API calls to identify the calling program. It's essentially a password that allows applications to communicate with Livepeer. API-Keys ensure that the request is coming from a trusted source, helping platforms manage and control who can access their data and functionalities.

## Multistream

Multistream is a feature that amplifies the reach of a single broadcast by simultaneously sending it to multiple streaming platforms. With Multistream, you can take one source stream, along with its transcoded versions, and push it to various RTMP(S) targets in real-time. This means you can broadcast the same content on platforms like Twitch, Facebook Live, and YouTube Live all at once.

It not only saves bandwidth and resources but also ensures a broader audience base across different platforms gets to view the content without any need for separate, individual streams for each platform

## Encrypted Asset

An encrypted asset refers to a video content/asset that has been encrypted to protect its data from unauthorized access. Encryption transforms the original content into a format that can only be decoded and played back using a specific key or set of credentials. This ensures that the asset remains confidential and can only be accessed or viewed by those with the necessary permissions
