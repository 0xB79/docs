An in-browser broadcast refers to the process of transmitting live video content directly from a user's web browser to online audiences in real-time, facilitated by Livepeer's low latency WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology. This method eliminates the need for specialized broadcasting equipment or external software such as OBS, allowing content creators to engage with their viewers effortlessly.

Process Overview:

- Configuration and Initialization:
  - A Livepeer client is established within the web application using the `livepeer.js` library, creating a connection to Livepeer's infrastructure.
  - A livestream object, known as a "Stream" is created through Livepeer's API, setting the foundation for the live video feed.
- Broadcast Initiation:
  - The broadcasting interface is seamlessly integrated into the web application using the `Broadcast` component provided by the `livepeer.js` library.
  - The component is configured with the appropriate stream key, and custom styling options are applied to ensure a consistent user experience.
- WebRTC Broadcasting:
  - The user's webcam and microphone capture live video and audio content directly from the browser.
  - WebRTC technology is employed to transmit this media content to Livepeer's infrastructure in real-time.
- Stream Presentation:
  - The live video content is made accessible to viewers through an embedded iframe or player on the web page.
  - The iframe references a specific URL associated with the stream key, allowing viewers to watch the broadcast.
- STUN/TURN Server Utilization:
  - STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers are utilized to enhance network connectivity, ensuring minimal disruptions due to firewalls or network challenges.

In-browser broadcasting through Livepeer's WebRTC technology empowers content creators to effortlessly share live video content with their audiences, fostering real-time engagement and interaction directly from the web browser.
