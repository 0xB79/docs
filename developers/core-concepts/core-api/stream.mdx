A Stream is representing a Live Stream Object that can be identified, recorded, and processed within Livepeer. Stream is a video feed being broadcasted in real-time. Livepeer is responsible for the life cycle management (CRUD) of a Stream. A Stream is uniquely identified by the Stream ID, and associated with a defined metadata describing its characteristics (see the screenshot). A Stream is created when create stream API (`POST /stream`) is executed successfully. Once a Stream is created, there are set of webhook events to notify its state transitions, including `stream.started`, `stream.idle`.

If Recording is enabled, there is a set of webhook events to notify recordingâ€™s state transitions including: `recording.ready`, `recording.started`, `recording.waiting`. The recording can be stored as an Asset[Ref to Asset]. A Stream can also be directed to multiple stream targets, such as youbube, twitter, using [MultiStream](/developers/core-concepts/core-api/multiparticipant-stream). Using Livepeer [Player](/developers/core-concepts/player), a stream can be easily viewed by passing Playback ID, while using 3rd party player, a full playback url is required.

RTMP is the ingest protocol for streaming, while WebRTC by default is playback protocol and HLS as fall back, when Livepeer Player is used. WebRTC will ensure a low latency playback around 2-5s on transcoded renditions, and sub-s on source.

While a Stream is delivered, [Stream Health](/developers/core-concepts/studio/stream-health) is an object provides a set of metrics about its monitoring state. Further more, Viewer Engagement Metrics provide more comprehensive of viewer behavior using Livepeer Engagement API.
