Gated Playback is a webhook based framework for applications to customize
their authorized video/stream playback control. Whenever a stream playback
request is initiated, Livepeer initiated a `playback.accessControl` webhook
event, as a result, applications can register a webhook handler to respond to
this event by checking the Access Control Conditions. If it is authorized,
Livepeer will enable “playback”, otherwise rejected. Using this framework, a
blockchain agonistic Token Gating feature can be easily implemented. Rich ACC
providers, such as lit has been integrated.
