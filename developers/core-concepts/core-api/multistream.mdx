A multistream is an advanced capability within the Livepeer that facilitates the simultaneous broadcast of a source stream, along with its transcoded renditions, to various RTMP(s) destinations like Twitch, Facebook Live, and YouTube Live. This feature ensures that users can maximize their audience reach across multiple platforms with a single streaming session.

In setting up multistreaming, users have the option to either utilize the [Studio](https://livepeer.studio) or directly interface with the [Livepeer REST API](/api-reference) or the [Livepeer SDK](/sdks). All options offer comprehensive management tools to configure, modify, or delete specific Multistream Targets linked with individual streams. It's important to note that configurations are stream-specific; hence, they don't automatically transfer when generating new streams. The essential parameters for setting up a target include naming the target, adding the mandatory Ingest URL, and, if relevant, adding a stream key, provided by Livepeer. Users can also specify which rendition profile they intend to dispatch to the target.

After creating a Multistream Target, there's flexibility in toggling its activation status. Both the dashboard and API provide options for editing or deleting these targets. However, to initiate multistreaming, merely establishing a Multistream Target object isn't sufficient. This target needs to be referenced within the Stream object it's associated with.

For performance monitoring and understanding stream health, Studio offers real-time indicators through its dashboard and API, showing whether a Multistream Target is currently active or offline. Such status updates might experience slight delays before the stream's live status gets mirrored on the destination platform. Via the dashboard's "Health" tab, users can obtain a detailed view of the ingest rate for the active source stream.

Additionally, Livepeer have three webhooks to monitor Multistream Targets:

1. `multistream.connected`: Indicates a successful connection to the Multistream Target and confirms the stream's live status on the corresponding service.
2. `multistream.error`: Flags issues during the connection process, suggesting potential configuration errors or problems with the destination platform.
3. `multistream.disconnected`: Notifies users when a stream concludes and multistreaming to a particular target has also ended.
