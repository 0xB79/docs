Livepeer API uses API keys (Bearer Authentication ) to verify and authorize requests. You can manage and review your API keys through Livepeer Studio. You need to pass your API key in the header with `Bearer` prefix while sending a request.

It's important to note that your API keys come with significant privileges, so it's essential to keep them safe and secure! Refrain from sharing your secret API keys in GitHub or other publicly accessible places

By default, API keys can only be used from a backend server. This is to ensure maximum security and prevent that you accidentally expose your account by including the secret API key in some public web page. More info about enabling CORS can be found here
